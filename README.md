# Domex
The project is about a small idea that allows users to get notified through E-mail when their favorite domains are being expired. A reminder mail will be sent before the domain expires. The website is created in **Flask** and **SQLite**. You can host it very easily. You can also modify it easily to add more features. The domain information is taken from **whois**. 

# How to host in localhost

Install whois: `pip install python-whois`

# How to host in Remote server
